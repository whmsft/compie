#Calcy
# Python's eval() function can be limiting but calcy can't be

Calcy is a python module which is made by a person who wanted to do many many calculations inside python
but thought that "Why import different modules for the same work? Let's make my own one!"
and so calcy is made..

Factorial:
```
>>> import calcy
>>> calcy.factorial(5)
>>> 120
```

Evaluate:
```
>>> import calcy
>>> calcy.evaluate("2*3+100-190+factorial(3)-pi")
>>> -81.1415926535898
```
